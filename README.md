# Driving_Simulator_with_VxWorks_and_Unreal_Engine
The application is a driving simulator which allows the user to drive a car in a predefined map with some obstacles. The car can also moves by itself, reaching a predefined destination point avoiding obstacles, if needed. The graphical software is an Unreal Engine application running on a general purpose operating system mounted on laptop or on a desktop computer. The calculation software runs in a computing board equipped with a real-time operating system called VxVorks developed by WindRiver.
